## The submission categories

1. Astar MainPrize (New Product)
2. JPYC



## What it does
FUJI NFT is a Japanese Yen-based Non-custodial NFT marketplace where Users only need JPYC to buy & sell NFT.

We consider it an indispensable marketplace for mass adoption.



## The problem it solves
For Buyers, they do not need to create a CEX account to prepare cryptocurrency, because JPYC can be purchased with a credit card or bank transfer.

For Sellers, they can convert sales proceeds into cash easily, the sales proceeds have Low volatility, and they can calculate taxes easily.



## Technologies I used
- AccountAbstruction (Banana SDK)
- Metatransaction (JPYC V2)
- ThirdwebSDK
- React

## Why Astar?
That's because Astar has strong relationships with Japanese companies

When working with companies on web3 projects, I think NFT projects will make up the majority. Therefore, a Japanese yen-based marketplace that is easy for both buyers and sellers to use is necessary on the Astar chain.


## Only for Japan?
No.

The safety of Japanese stablecoins is attracting attention worldwide. If JPYC becomes frequently used in Asia and globally, the demand for an NFT marketplace that can only be used with JPYC will also increase.
